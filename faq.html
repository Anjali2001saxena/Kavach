      <h5>What is COVID-19?</h5>
          <p>COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.  WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China.</p>
              
      <h5>What are symptoms of COVID-19?</h5>
          <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are:</p>
          <ul>
          	<li>Fever</li>
            <li>Dry cough</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Loss of taste or smell,</li>
	<li>Nasal congestion,</li>
	<li>Conjunctivitis (also known as red eyes)</li>
	<li>Sore throat,</li>
	<li>Headache,</li>
	<li>Muscle or joint pain,</li>
	<li>Different types of skin rash,</li>
	<li>Nausea or vomiting,</li>
	<li>Diarrhea,</li>
	<li>Chills or dizziness.</li>
</ul>

<h5>What happens to people who get COVID-19?</h5>
<p>Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.</p>
<p>Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys.</p>
<p>In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection.</p>

<h5>Who is most at risk of severe illness from COVID-19?</h5>
<p>People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, obesity or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.</p>
<p>However, anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. </p>

<h5>Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?</h5>
<p>Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms.</p>

<h5>I want to find out if I had COVID-19 in the past, what test could I take?</h5>
<p>Antibody tests can tell us whether someone has had an infection in the past, even if they have not had symptoms. Also known as serological tests and usually done on a blood sample, these tests detect antibodies produced in response to an infection. In most people, antibodies start to develop after days to weeks and can indicate if a person has had past infection. Antibody tests cannot be used to diagnose COVID-19 in the early stages of infection or disease but can indicate whether or not someone has had the disease in the past.</p>

<h5>How long does it take to develop symptoms?</h5>
<p>The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for 14 days, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available.</p>

<h5>What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?</h5>
<p>If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for instructions and find out when and where to get a test, stay at home for 14 days away from others and monitor your health.

If you have shortness of breath or pain or pressure in the chest, seek medical attention at a health facility immediately. Call your health care provider or hotline in advance for direction to the right health facility.

If you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever, seek medical care if you have a fever.

If local guidance recommends visiting a medical centre for testing, assessment or isolation, wear a medical mask while travelling to and from the facility and during medical care. Also keep at least a 1-metre distance from other people and avoid touching surfaces with your hands.  This applies to adults and children.</p>

<h5>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?</h5>
<p>Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19.

In hospitals, physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections which can be a complication of COVID-19 in severely ill patients. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.</p>
