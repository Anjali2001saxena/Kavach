# KAVACH

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
COVID-19 pandemic has hit the world hard last year and the only solution to it is to get the majority of the population vaccinated but amid the inadequate amount of vaccine supplies, vaccination wastage is further exaggerating the problem. Also, old and specially abled people find it difficult to commute to vaccination centres which becomes a challenge in the vaccination process. One way to tackle this problem is to use mobile vaccination vans to vaccinate the population. So, there is a need for an efficient system that will ensure minimum wastage of vaccines while systematically carrying out the mobile vaccination process. 

## INTRODUCTION
KAVACH is a web portal that will help in reducing the vaccine wastage by efficiently managing the available vaccine shots and taking immediate actions for reducing the wastage by redistributing and sharing vaccines between different centers. Also, it will help in managing mobile vaccination drives in an efficient manner.

## FEATURES
- **Surplus Vaccines Availability Report :** <br>
COVID-19 vaccine has a shelf life of 4-6 months and if it is not used in the given duration it expires leading to vaccine wastage. At some vaccination centers the amount of available vaccines is more than their requirement and expires before they are taken in use while some centers face scarcity of vaccines. So, vaccines could be redistributed between such centers so as to minimize the wastage and make vaccines available for everyone. <br>
Vaccination Centers can post the information about extra doses of vaccines available (in comparison to expected requirement based on number of registrations and observed data of vaccination at the center) on the website at least 1 month before the expiry date of vaccine. Information should include vaccine name and number of extra doses available along with the center's contact details.<br>
Details of all such centers will be available on the website with all the information and centers with requirement of vaccines can contact them directly to borrow the vaccination doses and can fulfill their requirements. <br>
(Vaccination doses with early expiry should be prioritised for use and sharing to minimize the wastage)
<br><br>

- **Open Vial Availability Report :** <br>
COVID-19 vaccine comes in vial with a capacity of 10 doses. Vial once opened needs to be used within 4 hours, else needs to be discarded. At some vaccination centers vials with some doses are wasted because of lack of attendees present at time to consume the entire vial and it expires before they are taken in use. <br>
Vaccination Centers can post the information about open vials available on the website at least 1 hour before the expiry time of vaccine. Information should include vaccine name and number of doses available along with the center's contact details.<br>
Details of all such centers will be available on the website with all the information and these doses can be collected urgently and be used to vaccinate people with special needs in that area.
<br><br>

- **Mobile Vaccination Management :** <br>
Mobile Vaccination can reduce the vaccine wastage to a large extent because of beforehand knowledge of vaccine requirements which reduces the extra supplies/ stocking of vaccine at one place which can efficiently be used at other centers. But converting the entire vaccination process to mobile vaccination would not be a good idea because it will not be economical and feasible. So, mobile vaccination drives could be conducted along with normal vaccination to speed up the process.<br>
Mobile vaccination could be efficiently managed using KAVACH in following ways: <br>
1. **Community Registrations :**
Communities/Organizations(like societies, companies, etc.)  can register for a Mobile Vaccination drive on the website. Community representatives can send a request to any vaccination center available for mobile vaccination in their area with proper information about the number of people that will be attending the drive and his/her contact details. Once they put up a request, mail will be sent to the center regarding the request and the center can respond with available slots for drive to confirm the registration.<br>

2. **Senior Citizens / Specially-abled Registrations :**
People who canâ€™t commute to vaccination centers can register for a Mobile Vaccination drive on the website. But their vaccination process would be a bit different from others. Vaccination would be done on an urgent basis.<br>
Whenever center posts about open vial availability, volunteers will contact the people registered for mobile vaccination and will confirm their availability then vaccination team from that center( center and registered beneficiary should be in the same area for fast process before dose is expired) will reach out to them for vaccination. 
<br><br>

- **Volunteer Registration :** <br>
Volunteers will act as mediators between vaccination centers and beneficiaries registered for mobile vaccination for managing urgent vaccination drives. Whenever any center will post about open vial availability, they will search for registered people for mobile vaccination drive in the same area as that of the center( all the data will be available on the website and they can search for beneficiaries in same area by using pincode) and will check the availability of beneficiary on urgent basis and convey the information to vaccination center.
<br><br>

- **User Stories :** <br>
COVID Vaccine beneficiaries can share their experiences related to COVID vaccination. They just need to post their short story/feedback along with their name on the portal and their story will be shared on the portal with other users. People can motivate others to get vaccinated by sharing their stories and experiences.
